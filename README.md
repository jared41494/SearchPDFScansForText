<h1>Search PDF Scans for Text</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>
	I stumbled upon this work proposal on Upwork. Ironically, it wasn't mean for a programmer; the job was a data entry job. The potential candidate would have to open the Excel file, click the PDF file, find the FEI #, update the Excel file, and repeat. So, I utilized my Python skills to do the process for me. Unfortunately, I found that the program isn't 100% perfect. Out of the ten records in this Excel document, it only finds eight of the numbers. Feel free to clone the project and use it for your needs. Currently, the text search is just a simple regex that searches for a ten-digit number.
