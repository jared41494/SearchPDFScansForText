<h1>Search PDF Scans for Text</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

<p>
	I stumbled upon this work proposal on Upwork. Ironically, it wasn't mean for a programmer; the job was a data entry job. The potential candidate would have to open the Excel file, click the PDF file, find the FEI #, update the Excel file, and repeat. So, I utilized my Python skills to do the process for me. Unfortunately, I found that the program isn't 100% perfect. Out of the ten records in this Excel document, it only finds eight of the numbers.
